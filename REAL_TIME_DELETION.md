# Real-Time Message Deletion Feature

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced real-time message deletion feature that provides instant propagation of message deletions to both sender and receiver through WebSocket events.

## Features

### ✅ Completed Enhancements

1. **Real-time Deletion Propagation**: When a user deletes a message, all users in the room see the deletion instantly via WebSocket.

2. **Visual Deletion Indicators**: Deleted messages show:
   - 🗑️ Trash icon next to deleted message text
   - "You deleted this message" for the sender
   - "This message was deleted" for receivers
   - Proper styling with muted colors

3. **Backend WebSocket Broadcasting**: The backend automatically broadcasts deletion events to all connected clients in the room.

4. **Consistent State**: Both sender and receiver see the same deletion state without needing to refresh.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Delete API Endpoint (`/message/delete`)

```go
// Request body now optionally includes room_id
{
    "message_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "room_id": "room_123"  // Optional but recommended
}

// Response includes room information
{
    "status": "Message deleted",
    "message_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "room_id": "room_123"
}
```

#### 2. Automatic WebSocket Broadcasting

When a message is deleted via the REST API, the backend automatically:
1. Marks the message as `deleted: true` in MongoDB
2. Retrieves the room information from the message
3. Broadcasts a deletion event to all connected WebSocket clients in that room

```go
// Deletion event broadcast structure
{
    "type": "deletion",
    "message_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "room_id": "room_123",
    "sender_id": 1
}
```

#### 3. New Service Function

Added `GetMessageByID()` service function to retrieve message details before deletion for broadcasting purposes.

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced MessageBubble Component

- Added trash icon (🗑️) next to deleted message text
- Improved styling for deleted messages
- Different messages for sender vs receiver:
  - Sender: "You deleted this message"
  - Receiver: "This message was deleted"

#### 2. Improved ChatContainer

- Updated `handleDelete()` to send room_id with deletion requests
- Immediate local state update for better UX
- Removed redundant WebSocket sending (backend handles broadcasting)

#### 3. Updated API Service

- `deleteMessage()` now accepts optional `roomId` parameter
- Sends room_id to backend for proper event broadcasting

#### 4. WebSocket Event Handling

Both WebSocket hooks (`useWebSocket.js` and `useWebSocketNew.js`) already had proper deletion event handling:

```javascript
case 'deletion':
  setMessages(prev => 
    prev.map(msg => {
      if (msg.id === data.message_id || msg.message_id === data.message_id) {
        return { ...msg, deleted: true };
      }
      return msg;
    })
  );
  break;
```

## Usage Example

### 1. User A deletes a message

```bash
# API call made by frontend
POST /message/delete
{
    "message_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "room_id": "room_123"
}
```

### 2. Backend processes deletion

1. Updates message in MongoDB: `deleted: true`
2. Broadcasts WebSocket event to all clients in `room_123`:

```json
{
    "type": "deletion",
    "message_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "room_id": "room_123",
    "sender_id": 1
}
```

### 3. All connected clients receive the event

- **User A** (sender): Shows "🗑️ You deleted this message"
- **User B** (receiver): Shows "🗑️ This message was deleted"
- Both see the change instantly without refresh

## Testing the Feature

### Prerequisites

1. Backend server running on port 8080
2. Frontend running on port 3000 (or configured port)
3. At least 2 browser windows/tabs for testing sender/receiver views

### Test Steps

1. **Setup**: Open two browser windows, login as different users
2. **Create Room**: Start a chat between the two users
3. **Send Messages**: Send several messages from User A to User B
4. **Delete Message**: User A deletes one of their messages
5. **Verify**: 
   - User A sees "🗑️ You deleted this message"
   - User B sees "🗑️ This message was deleted" instantly
   - Both see consistent state without refresh

### Expected Behavior

- ✅ Instant propagation to all room participants
- ✅ Proper visual indicators with trash icon
- ✅ Different messages for sender vs receiver
- ✅ No need to refresh to see changes
- ✅ Consistent state across all clients

## Technical Architecture

```
[User A Browser] ──delete──> [REST API] ──update──> [MongoDB]
       │                         │
       │                         ▼
       │                   [WebSocket Hub]
       │                         │
       ▼                         ▼
[WebSocket A] <──deletion──> [WebSocket B]
       │                         │
       ▼                         ▼
[User A sees:                [User B sees:
"You deleted this msg"]      "This message was deleted"]
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Instant feedback without page refreshes
2. **Consistent State**: All participants see the same view
3. **Real-time Communication**: Leverages existing WebSocket infrastructure
4. **Visual Clarity**: Clear indication of deleted messages with icons
5. **Contextual Messages**: Different text for sender vs receiver
