// Real-Time Message Deletion Demo
// Test this feature manually by following these steps:

/* 
SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
===================

1. Start the backend server:
   cd backend && go run main.go

2. Start the frontend:
   cd frontend && npm run dev

3. Open two browser windows/tabs:
   - Window 1: http://localhost:3000 (User A)
   - Window 2: http://localhost:3000 (User B)

4. Login with different users in each window

5. Navigate both to the same chat room, e.g.:
   - http://localhost:3000/chat/demo-room
*/

/* 
TESTING STEPS:
==============

Step 1: Send Test Messages
---------------------------
User A: "Hello, this is my first message!"
User B: "Hi there! Nice to meet you."
User A: "This message will be deleted in a moment."
User B: "I can see your messages in real-time!"

Step 2: Delete a Message
------------------------
1. User A hovers over "This message will be deleted in a moment."
2. User A clicks the three-dot menu (⋮) that appears
3. User A clicks "Delete" option (🗑️ Delete)

Step 3: Observe Real-Time Results
---------------------------------
IMMEDIATELY (without refresh):

User A will see:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🗑️ You deleted this message         │
│ (styled in blue/muted blue text)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

User B will see:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🗑️ This message was deleted         │
│ (styled in gray/muted gray text)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
*/

/* 
BACKEND API FLOW:
=================

1. Frontend makes API call:
   POST /message/delete
   {
     "message_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
     "room_id": "demo-room"
   }

2. Backend processes:
   - Updates MongoDB: { deleted: true }
   - Retrieves room info from message
   - Broadcasts WebSocket event to all room clients

3. WebSocket event sent to all room participants:
   {
     "type": "deletion",
     "message_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011", 
     "room_id": "demo-room",
     "sender_id": 1
   }

4. Frontend receives event and updates UI instantly

/* 
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
=======================

✅ User A sees "You deleted this message" with trash icon
✅ User B sees "This message was deleted" with trash icon  
✅ Change appears INSTANTLY without refresh
✅ Message styling is muted/grayed out
✅ No reaction buttons on deleted messages
✅ No reply option on deleted messages
✅ Original message content is hidden
✅ WebSocket connection remains stable
✅ Other messages are unaffected
✅ Deletion works across multiple rooms
*/

/* 
ADVANCED TESTING:
=================

Test Edge Cases:
1. Delete message when recipient is offline (should see deletion when they return)
2. Delete message in group chat (all participants should see)
3. Delete very old messages (should work the same)
4. Delete messages with attachments (attachments should be hidden)
5. Delete messages with reactions (reactions should be hidden)

Network Conditions:
1. Delete with slow network (should have local immediate update)
2. Delete with WebSocket disconnected (should work via API, sync when reconnected)
3. Delete with multiple tabs open (all tabs should sync)

Error Scenarios:
1. Delete non-existent message (should show error)
2. Delete someone else's message (should not be allowed)
3. Delete already deleted message (should handle gracefully)

/* 
EXPECTED CONSOLE LOGS:
======================

User A Console:
- "Sending delete request for message: 507f..."
- "Message deleted successfully: 507f..."
- "WebSocket message received: {type: 'deletion', ...}"

User B Console: 
- "WebSocket message received: {type: 'deletion', ...}"
- "Updated message state: deleted = true"

Backend Console:
- "Message deletion request received"
- "Broadcasting deletion event to room: demo-room"
- "Deletion event sent to X connected clients"
